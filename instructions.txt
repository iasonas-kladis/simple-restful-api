Instructions
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/iasonas-kladis/simple-restful-api.git

2. Import the maven project to the IDE of your choice, or create a new simple Maven project and copy the
   source code and the pom.xml file in it. I used the Eclipse IDE.

3. Install the Maven dependencies from the pom.xml file. In Eclipse this is done by right clicking the pom.xml file
   and running as Maven Install.

4. Start the MariaDB server. Import the provided dump sql file in a new database called "database".
   This is required so as not to change the code in java.
   Credentials used are u/n: root, p/w: admin.

5. Start the API class from your IDE. This will get the controller running.

6. Start the index.html webpage in your browser. You are all set.
